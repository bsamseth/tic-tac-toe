# Tic-Tac-Toe AI

This is a simple little game playing "AI" that can play Tic-Tac-Toe (Noughts
and crosses), written in Python. You may play against it in a simple command
line interface. You will never win, however, as the AI never plays a move
allowing you to do so.

This project was made as a simple demo of game playing computer programs,
illustrating an implementation of the minimax algorithm.
